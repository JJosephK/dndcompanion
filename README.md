Project Title:
•	Dungeons and Dragons Companion Application
Description:
The application will be a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) companion web application. The application will provide the user with an assortment of helpful tools to aid in their D&D campaign. The web app will have a different login for the Dungeon Master (DM) and players. The DM will be provided with unique tools that are only intended to be used by the DM. The dungeon master may approve the creation or deletion of character sheets and other character information whereas the character may only adjust some of the fields of their character sheet.
Common features include saving character information and other information typically found on a character sheet. The statistics and information included for the player characters will be stored in a database so that the player-statistics are available upon login without having to re-enter the data. Some additional functions include a gold reserve system. The gold reserve system will be a running total of the amount of gold in the player’s inventory and keep track of changes to the player’s inventory to adjust the gold total when appropriate. 
The dungeon master will be able to save information on monsters and recall their information from a database when needed.  The D20 has become a symbol of tabletop RPGs, so a dice roller is included in the application. The randomness of the dice helps determine the outcome of encounters and the abilities of players. Since D&D uses different sided dice, there will be a couple different options for random number generation. The app may also include location data for the different characters or non-player characters (NPCs) if the DM wants to track that information through the application.
