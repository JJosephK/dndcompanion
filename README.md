Project Idea Summary: The application will be a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) companion web application. The app will provide the user with an assortment of helpful tools to aid in DnD sessions. The web app will have a different login for the Dungeon Master (DM) and players. The DM will be provided with unique tools that are only intended to be used by the DM. Common features include saving character information and other information typically found on a character sheet. The statistics and information included for the player characters will be stored in a database so that the player-statistics are available upon login without having to re-enter the data. Some additional functions include a gold reserve system. The gold reserve system will be a running total of the amount of gold in the player’s inventory and keep track of changes to the player’s inventory to adjust the gold total when appropriate. The dungeon master will be able to save information on monsters and bring them into use when needed. A dice roller is a useful function as a major facet of DnD is the randomness of the dice roll which helps determine the outcome of encounters. The app may also include location data for the different characters or non-player characters (NPCs).
